##ComputerGraphics

<p>lab1: the user should click a polygon, and, without using the fill_polygon method, the polygon should fill itself</p>

<p>lab2: the user should be able to input a given .xy file and depending and rotate as longs as key is pressed (with respects to command line)</p>

<p>lab3: an extension of lab2, but the user should be able to click a convex shape and be able to crop the view to that shape</p>

<p>lab4: Build 3d objects
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>c = reverse direction</li>
<li>t = translate</li>
<li>x = to rotate around the x-axis</li>
<li>y = to rotate around the y-axis</li>
<li>z = to rotate around the z-axis</li></ul>

<p>lab5: use lab4 to create only visual side (i.e. no back)</p>
<p>lab6: draw the 3d polygons using painters algorithm</p>
<p>lab7: light model</p>
<p>lab8: 3d clipping</p>
